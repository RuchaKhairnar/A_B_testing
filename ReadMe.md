A mobile game 'cookie cats' has launched two versions of its game, gate_30 and gate_40, and wants look at the difference in user behaviour after a day and after a week in both of the games so as to to decide which version of the game appeals to the user base more and makes the user stay for longer time. 

I have used two proportion Z-test to calculate the difference in proportions for the two versions.

There is significant difference in proportion of people who left after playing both versions of the game after a day.

It is evident from the estimates that gate_40 version is more successfull in making users stay compared to gate_30.


A similar hypothesis is observed in users who left after playing for a week. There is significant difference in proportion of people who left and here too, gate_40 is more reliable in making users stay.
